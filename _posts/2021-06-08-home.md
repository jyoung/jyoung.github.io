Hi, I'm Joe
I am a software developer and avid fly fisher currently living in Oklahoma City with my wife, Ashley and our two daughters.

Born and raised in Texas, we moved to Oklahoma in 2005.

I spent a couple years in Vermont at [Norwich](https://www.norwich.edu/) as a member of the Corps of Cades and the finished college at [Tarleton State](https://www.tarleton.edu/) in Stephenville Texas with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Information Systems.

After college, I got my first job at a company called MTW (Making Technology Work) as a [COOL:Gen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA_Gen) developer. My role was building proxies between VB6 COM components and mainframe systems. Eventually, I got into the web development side of things and started building the ASP and VB6 COM objects that powered our app.

After MTW, I went back to Tarleton this time as a Web Developer working for the university. Started on my Masters just because it was something to do and I got an employee discount on the tuition. It was a great place to live and work and I met my wife there and yes she was a student, a senior, at the time. After she graduated, we moved up to OKC.

I spent 11 years as a Software Developer at [MTM Recognition](http://www.mtmrecognition.com/) working with ASP.NET using C#. That was a great ride and allowed to me grow tremendously as a developer and build some really interesting applications such as [Carousel](https://mtmrecognition.com/social-recognition/).

After MTM, I did a short stint at [Paycom](https://www.paycom.com), before an oppurtunity came up at [Express Professionals](https://www.expresspros.com/) working in their back office on modernization and automation initiatives with [LANSA](https://www.lansa.com).

These days at Express I spend most of my time gluing different systems together with [MuleSoft](https://www.mulesoft.com)

When I'm not at work, I am either hanging out with my family or out fishing. 

I have become a pretty avid fly fisher, which may seem a bit odd being here in Okalhoma, but fly fishing is not just for trout these days.

Oklahoma does have some trout streams that I often go to, but I can also be out on the local lakes fishing for sunfish, crappie and bass. 

My favorite is fly fishing in the salt. Inshore sight fishing for Redfish is my favorite pastime. :D
